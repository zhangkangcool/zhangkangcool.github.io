I'm Ken, an individual developer. Fluence Network is a Web3 project focused on decentralized serverless technology. Currently, we are conducting an airdrop for GitHub accounts that have contributed to open-source projects, including but not limited to web3 and Kubernetes (k8s). I noticed that your GitHub account qualifies for this airdrop. Please be aware that there is a time limit for claiming your reward. Make sure to claim it promptly. 


这个奖励计划与Fluence Network相关，但请注意，我不是其官方代表，而是作为项目的热心支持者和社区成员之一，想向你介绍这个潜在的机会。
This reward program is associated with Fluence Network. However, please note that I am not an official representative of Fluence Network, but rather a passionate supporter and community member of the project. I wanted to introduce this potential opportunity to you.

I am willing to offer a price higher than 3000 RMB/400 USD/13000 TWD. You don't need to pay any fees. To claim the airdrop, there is an interaction required with the Ethereum network, which involves approximately $50 USD worth of Ethereum as transaction fees. However, if you find it troublesome, may I ask if you would be interested in selling your airdrop eligibility?
