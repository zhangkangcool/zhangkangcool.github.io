# 1 Builder

弄一个Builder，使用BuildFactory

Which control exactly *how* each build is performed (with a series of `BuildStep`s, configured in a `BuildFactory`). Each `Build` is run on a single worker.



```python
from buildbot.plugins import steps, util

# first, let's create the individual step objects

# step 1: make clean; this fails if the worker has no local copy, but
# is harmless and will only happen the first time
makeclean = steps.ShellCommand(name="make clean",
                               command=["make", "clean"],
                               description="make clean")

# step 2: svn update (here updates trunk, see the docs for more
# on how to update a branch, or make it more generic).
checkout = steps.SVN(baseURL='svn://myrepo/projects/coolproject/trunk',
                     mode="update",
                     username="foo",
                     password="bar",
                     haltOnFailure=True)

# step 3: make all
makeall = steps.ShellCommand(name="make all",
                             command=["make", "all"],
                             haltOnFailure=True,
                             description="make all")

# step 4: make packages
makepackages = steps.ShellCommand(name="make packages",
                                  command=["make", "packages"],
                                  haltOnFailure=True,
                                  description="make packages")

# step 5: upload packages to central server. This needs passwordless ssh
# from the worker to the server (set it up in advance as part of worker setup)
uploadpackages = steps.ShellCommand(
    name="upload packages",
    description="upload packages",
    command="scp packages/*.rpm packages/*.deb packages/*.tgz someuser@somehost:/repository",
    haltOnFailure=True)

# create the build factory and add the steps to it
f_simplebuild = util.BuildFactory()
f_simplebuild.addStep(makeclean)
f_simplebuild.addStep(checkout)
f_simplebuild.addStep(makeall)
f_simplebuild.addStep(makepackages)
f_simplebuild.addStep(uploadpackages)

# finally, declare the list of builders. In this case, we only have one builder
c['builders'] = [
    util.BuilderConfig(name="simplebuild", workernames=['worker1', 'worker2', 'worker3'],
                       factory=f_simplebuild)
]
```





# Schedulers

什么时候运行Builder，可设置间隔，切换分支等，使用上面定义的`simplebuild`。

Which decide when builds should be performed. They collect `Change`s into `BuildRequest`s, which are then queued for delivery to `Builders` until a worker is available.

```python
from buildbot.plugins import schedulers

# define the dynamic scheduler for trunk
trunkchanged = schedulers.SingleBranchScheduler(name="trunkchanged",
                                                change_filter=util.ChangeFilter(branch=None),
                                                treeStableTimer=300,
                                                builderNames=["simplebuild-trunk"])

# define the dynamic scheduler for the 7.2 branch
branch72changed = schedulers.SingleBranchScheduler(
    name="branch72changed",
    change_filter=util.ChangeFilter(branch='branches/7.2'),
    treeStableTimer=300,
    builderNames=["simplebuild-72"])

# define the available schedulers
c['schedulers'] = [trunkchanged, branch72changed]
```





# Change sources

源代码修改时，每五分钟拉一次代码

Which create a Change object each time something is modified in the VC repository. Most `ChangeSource`s listen for messages from a hook script of some sort. Some sources actively poll the repository on a regular basis. All `Change`s are fed to the schedulers.

```python
c['change_source'] = []
c['change_source'].append(changes.GitPoller(
        'git://github.com/zhangkangcool/hello-world.git',
        workdir='gitpoller-workdir', branch='master',
        pollInterval=300))
```



看到一次change后，等一段时间再build，因为开发人员可能会提交几个change，这样就可以一起测试，节约资源了。
