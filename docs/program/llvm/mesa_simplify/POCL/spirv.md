# Supported OpenCL features

All mandatory features for OpenCL 1.2 and 3.0 are supported on x86-64+Linux, see [OpenCL conformance](https://portablecl.org/docs/html/conformance.html#pocl-conformance) for details.

# Known unsupported OpenCL features

The known unsupported OpenCL features are listed here as encountered.

## Unimplemented device-side features

- OpenCL 2.0

  - pipes
  - device-side enqueue

- OpenCL 3.0

  see [OpenCL conformance](https://portablecl.org/docs/html/conformance.html#pocl-conformance) for the list

## Unimplemented host-side features

All 1.2 runtime API call are implemented. From the 2.x and 3.0 API, all should exist, but some might have “dummy” implementations (they always return an error).

## Unimplemented extensions

> - OpenGL interoperability extension
> - DirectX interoperability extension

# SPIR-V support

There is now extensive support available for SPIR-V.

Note that SPIR-V format supports different “capabilities” which in effect are different “dialects” of SPIR-V. The CPU driver supports the “Kernel” dialect, produced by llvm-spirv, Vulkan driver supports the “Shader” dialect produced by clspv.

## How to build PoCL with SPIR-V support (CPU / CUDA devices)

Support for SPIR-V binaries depends on functional llvm-spirv translator and some packages. See [Installation](https://portablecl.org/docs/html/install.html#pocl-install) for additional requirements for SPIR-V support.

Requirements:

- recent PoCL (4.0+ has most extensive support)
- recent LLVM (10.0+ works, for best experience 14+ is recommended)

To compile the LLVM SPIR-V translator:

```
git clone https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-LLVM-Translator
git checkout <branch>
```

Check out the corresponding branch for your installed LLVM version, then:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DLLVM_DIR=/path/to/LLVM/lib/cmake/llvm ..
make llvm-spirv
```

This will produce an executable, `tools/llvm-spirv/llvm-spirv`. You can copy this executable somewhere, then when running CMake on PoCL sources, add to the command line: `-DLLVM_SPIRV=/path/to/llvm-spirv`

## Compiling source to SPIR/SPIR-V

PoCL’s own binary format doesn’t use SPIR-V, but it’s possible to compile OpenCL sources directly to SPIR (LLVM IR with SPIR target), using Clang:

```
clang -Xclang -cl-std=CL1.2 -D__OPENCL_C_VERSION__=120  -D__OPENCL_VERSION__=120 \
 -Dcl_khr_int64 -Dcl_khr_byte_addressable_store -Dcl_khr_int64_extended_atomics \
 -Dcl_khr_global_int32_base_atomics -Dcl_khr_global_int32_extended_atomics \
 -Dcl_khr_local_int32_base_atomics -Dcl_khr_local_int32_extended_atomics \
 -Dcl_khr_3d_image_writes -Dcl_khr_fp64 -Dcl_khr_int64_base_atomics \
 -emit-llvm -target spir64-unknown-unknown \
 -Xclang -finclude-default-header \
 -o SPIR_OUTPUT.bc -x cl -c SOURCE.cl
```

The SPIR binary from previous command can be further compiled to SPIR-V with:

```
llvm-spirv -o SPIRV_OUTPUT.spv SPIR_OUTPUT.bc
```

## Limitations

The most complete support is for the CPU device on x86-64 and ARM64 platforms, but there is also some support for CUDA and CPU devices on other platforms.
